The Puku Story Festival can stand tall among Grahamstown&#39;s other prestigious festivals, says director Elinor Sisulu, with most hailing the new venue, NELM in Worcester Street, as a success. &quot;As organisers we were encouraged by artists and writers who contacted us asking to be part of the programme,&quot; Sisulu said after the fifth edition of the event.&nbsp; &quot;For example, playwright and dramatist Mandla Mbothwe asked &nbsp;to present an element of his work commemorating the 100th anniversary of the SS Mendi.&nbsp; &quot;Zakes Mda&#39;s publicist Kgauhelo Dube asked for the opportunity to present his latest children&#39;s book illustrated by his son Neo. Unfortunately Zakes could not come to the festival himself but he was represented by Neo and Kgauhelo. The programme was the richer for their participation.&nbsp; &quot;When the likes of Mandla Mbothwe and Zakes Mda see the Puku Festival as a platform to present their new work we can be justified in feeling that it really has become an event to be reckoned with. &quot;This can take its place in Grahamstown&#39;s calendar of festivals.&quot; Without a doubt, the main highlight was having Madosini as the Festival&#39;s guest of honour, Sisulu said. &quot;She more than fulfilled our expectations as a musician and a storyteller.&nbsp; &quot;The Conversation with Madosini revealed her humility and generosity towards the other artists and writers and those who attended were profoundly moved.&nbsp; &quot;The other major talking point of the festival was Mandla Mbothwe&#39;s SS Mendi commemoration. The powerfully haunting melody coming from a slight young girl in school uniform moving slowly through the main auditorium to the outside stage, followed by an eerie figure who looked as if it had been dredged from the sea is an image that will remain with those present for a long time.&nbsp; &quot;The complete silence of the audience, the awestruck expressions on the faces of the children and the animated conversations afterwards were testimony to the power of this piece of theatre.&quot;&nbsp; Sisulu said the work presented - &nbsp;from the young children who travelled from King William&#39;s Town to accomplished performers, MC Tsepiso Nzayo and upcoming imbongi Akhona Mfani - was of an exceptionally high standard.&nbsp; &quot;A major achievement was the interaction between the writers, artists and storytellers.&nbsp; &quot;Puku is proud to have brought together a group of people who might not otherwise have met and who will continue to collaborate with each other long after the festival,&quot; Sisulu said. There had been some logistical challenges mainly around transporting the children from schools to site visits and these emphasised the need for the Puku team to prepare well in advance of the event.&nbsp; However, Sisulu said the new venue - the National English Literary Museum - had worked very well. &quot;Most of the feedback we received was positive. There was an argument by some that a township venue would have attracted more people. This is a conversations that has to continue,&quot; Sisulu said. &nbsp; The good news is that there will definitely be a Puku Story Festival in Grahamstown in 2017.&nbsp; &quot;The main plan is to start preparing much earlier so that the programme is ready before the end of the year. This would involve intensive consultations with partners over a longer period of time,&quot; Sisulu said.
