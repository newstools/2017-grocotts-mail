Saturday&rsquo;s Graeme Rugby Day is just around the corner and shaping up to be one of the most highly anticipated yet. Three Grahamstown coaches have tough challenges ahead of them, but all are confident and keenly awaiting their opportunities to shine. With hosts Graeme College facing a formidable opponent in Selborne College from East London at 16h10, they are looking forward to their opportunity to make this year&rsquo;s rugby day one to remember. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a tough opponent in Selborne College, but we are excited at the opportunity to knock one of the big teams so early in the season.&rdquo; said Graeme 1st XV coach Jonty van der Meulen. Van der Meulen is confident in his team, given the fact that the majority of the players have experience playing at 1st team level. Crowds can expect a high fitness standard for Graeme&rsquo;s 1st XV this year, with Brad Robinson recently having been brought in as a strength and conditioning coach. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s as much pressure to win as there is to make our school proud&rdquo;, said Cameron Amos, Graeme College head boy and 1st XV scrumhalf. The hosts are raring to put on a superb show and leave everything between the four lines. With St Andrew&rsquo;s College Director of Rugby Andy Royle taking over as head coach after Gerry Posthumus&rsquo; 10 long years of service, Saturday&rsquo;s clash with Hudson will give fans another chance to gauge what effect this new beginning will have on the team. After a convincing 64-10 win against Union High School, Royle is eagerly awaiting the match, which starts at 15h00. &ldquo;Hudson has been improving for a while,&rdquo; admitted Royle. &ldquo;They have a good coach and a good set piece now.&rdquo; However, the coach&rsquo;s confidence in his team is unshakeable, as he looks to carry over their impressive form from the last match. Another game to keep an eye on will be Kingswood College&rsquo;s match against Pearson High at 13h50, with Kingswood sporting a revamped side - completely devoid of last year&rsquo;s 1st XV regulars, according to head coach Gareth Shaw. &ldquo;We have the fittest team we&rsquo;ve had in years. There are no particular superstars in the team this year&rdquo;, said Shaw, who views this is as beneficial to team chemistry. With a new director of rugby in Johnny Mallett, Kingswoodians will have the chance to see how their new 1st XV performs. Kingswood, St. Andrew&rsquo;s and Graeme 1st XV are all set to play at Somerset Field, while two other local schools will be in action at Marais A. P.J. Olivier 1st XV will face a side picked from Graeme College&rsquo;s 2nd &amp; 3rd XV at 9h15 AM, while Nathaniel Nyaluza Senior Secondary School kick off against Port Alfred High School 1st XV an hour later. *Like Grocott&#39;s Mail Sport on Facebook to follow all the action from Graeme Rugby Day&nbsp;as it happens. &nbsp;
