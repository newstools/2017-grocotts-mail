Karabo Baloyi dons her orange bib to take a closer look into the life and times of the Scifriends The shift starts early. Before any of the guests arrive, they&rsquo;re already milling around in the Monument, walking to their respective posts and putting on those bright orange bibs that never make any outfit look good. Then, before anyone is ever truly ready, the masses arrive. School children and teachers stream out of buses and taxis, the learners rushing to the main entrance while teachers try to slow them down and keep a certain level of order. The Scifriends at the entrance, also trying to keep order, look slightly surprised at the large number of uniformed children. The learners have to line up before walking through the door. Smaller groups &ndash; families and friends &ndash; also mill about near the lines.&nbsp; As soon as everyone walks in, the Scifriends stand at attention, ready to give directions, stop some of the children from bolting up the stairs and reassure the scientists and parents that all will go smoothly.&nbsp; Once the mayhem beginsscifrien, it does not stop &ndash; for hours on end. Workshops are facilitated and teachers and learners alike are entertained. Some of the Scifriends help facilitate the workshops. Others fulfil the duty of venue officers, getting venues for lectures and talks ready for the scientists. Some Scifriends act as Sciguides, leading the larger groups to their destinations without getting lost. When some learners do get lost, it is the duty of any Scifriend nearby to help them find the rest of their group. When phones, bags and money get lost, who you gonna call? Scifriends need to keep all involved calm in order to find some solution.&nbsp; In the end, a Scifriend&rsquo;s day ends in utter exhaustion but also a sense of fulfilment. Many hundreds of people leave Scifest happy. More often than not, a Scifriend added to that joy.&nbsp;
