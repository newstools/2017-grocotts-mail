Rhodes University has welcomed this week&#39;s announcement by the Minister of Finance, Pravin Gordhan, of an increase in the budget allocation for higher education and NSFAS.&nbsp; &ldquo;Access to education remains a huge challenge for the poor majority in our country. We need to continue to engage each other, through constructive dialogue, as stakeholders in the education value chain to find affordable and sustainable mechanisms of addressing this challenge while safeguarding the quality of public higher education,&rdquo; the University said in a statement issued by its Communications and Advancement Division.&nbsp; &ldquo;The increased budget will not only enable us continue to offer a quality education to our students within a financially sustainable framework, it will also contribute towards ensuring that academically deserving students are not excluded from institutions of higher learning for financial reasons.&rdquo;
