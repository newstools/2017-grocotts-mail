The vigilance of an alert sub-warden and Rhodes University&#39;s Campus Protection Unit last night helped facilitate the swift arrest of two suspects found in possession of house breaking equipment, according to a statement issued by the University&#39;s Communications and Advancement Division. The two men, apprehended on the University campus, were handed over to the police who are investigating a case of attempted trespassing and housebreaking, the University said and a possible link between yesterday&rsquo;s arrest and last week&rsquo;s attempted mugging of a female student on campus was now part of the ongoing high-level investigation. A female student escaped would-be muggers in the parking lot of the Africa Media Matrix building around 9pm on Thursday 23 March. Grocott&#39;s Mail staff, who were working in the AMM building were among those who ran to the young woman&#39;s assistance when they heard her screaming. The young woman was visibly distraught. Residence Councillor on the SRC Pumla Myeni, who was among the first on the scene along with other students in the vicinity, took the young woman to a nearby residence. The University said on Friday that a statement was received from the student involved and CCTV footage was being reviewed to aid the investigation. &quot;The student will continue to receive counselling and support from the University,&quot; the University said. &quot;We also commend the efforts of fellow students who came to the rescue of one of us. We also note the speedy response by both Campus Protection Unit and our psychologist who provided support to the student.&quot;
