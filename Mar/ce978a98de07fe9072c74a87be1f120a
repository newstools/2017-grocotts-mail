From storytelling and interactive exhibitions, to poetry sessions, musical acts and film screenings, the Redisa-sponsored Puku Story Festival held in Grahamstown from 21-26 February 2017 presented an array of educational activities to promote learning in mother tongue.&nbsp; The annual festival, which kicked off on International Mother Tongue Day (21 February), was hosted by the Puku Children&rsquo;s Literature Foundation in partnership with the National Arts Festival and the African Studies Department of Rhodes University.&nbsp; Teachers, learners and the general public were treated to captivating performances by veteran storytellers and musical legends, as well as up-and-coming young poets and authors, many of whom shared their thoughts about the importance of conserving the environment.&nbsp; Poet, musician, storyteller and children&rsquo;s book writer, Zanele Ndlovu, facilitated a workshop on how to make indigenous musical instruments from recycled material. &ldquo;What better way to teach our future leaders about important topics such as environmental conservation, recycling and turning waste into worth than through role models and respected community leaders and icons,&rdquo; said Redisa Director, Stacey Davidson.&nbsp; Throughout, festival goers were surprised to see how tyres can be used to create a variety of items from bags, book covers and pencil cases to floor paving, furniture, cushions and more. &nbsp; &ldquo;We also gave each child a Redisa story colouring-in book, which illustrates the many benefits of recycling&rdquo;, said Davidson. &ldquo;The 5th Puku Story Festival was a success beyond our expectations. With Redisa&#39;s support we were able to put on a programme of the highest artistic integrity. The festival has truly established itself as a platform for writers, artists and literacy activists developing indigenous language content for children of all ages.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are humbled by the enthusiastic support of our partners in Grahamstown who made this festival possible,&rdquo; said Elinor Sisulu, Chairperson of the Puku Children&rsquo;s Literature Foundation.
