The National Arts Festival is what set VGHS old girl Viwo Kulati on a course that will see her drop an album this year. The 21-year-old Grahamstown musician, currently completing a degree in Jazz Vocals at The University of Witwatersrand, credits the Festival, and the opportunities she had as a pupil at Victoria Girls&#39; High School for her love for music and her respect for the arts.&nbsp; The spark was in 2013, when she performed at a variety concert at St Andrews&#39; College, accompanied by friend and a musician Zininzi Feni. This encouraged her involvement in musical activities at school, where she took music, specialising in classical voice. You can watch her performance here: bit.ly/GrocViwo Her mature stage presence and powerful,d crystal-clear voice has seen her share stages with Thandiswa Mazwai, BLKJKS and The Brothers Move on.&nbsp; Her debut single &#39;Bawo&#39;, produced by and featuring the &nbsp;talented 2013 Standard Bank young jazz artist winner Nduduzo Makhathini, will soon be followed by her debut project this year. On Facebook, she posted, &quot;I have been hard at work recording so I&#39;m super excited to announce that I will be releasing my very first single produced and featuring the amazingly talented Nduduzo Makhathini. The release date is coming soon, so watch the space #DoWhatYouLove.&quot; Her success is made possible by a joint venture between ECAVC and Empire Music Production. Viwo has a large following in Grahamstown and would be glad to get the support of her hometown as she embarks on her journey.
