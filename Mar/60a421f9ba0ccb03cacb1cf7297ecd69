Three suspects linked to a June 2016 rhino poaching case at Buckland&rsquo;s Private Game Reserve 40km from Grahamstown remain in custody following a brief appearance in the magistrate&rsquo;s court in Grahamstown on Wednesday 15 March. The case in which Jabulani Ndlovu, Forget Ndlovu and Sithembiso Ndlovu are suspects was postponed for further investigation. The South African Police Service at the time hailed the men&rsquo;s arrest on 27 June 2016 at Makana Resort as a major breakthrough. In a media statement issued 20 June they said the men, who are not related to each other, might be linked to 10 or more poaching incidents in the Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal. During their late-night arrest at the resort at the southern exit of Grahamstown, police recovered a 72cm freshly harvested rhino horn, with an estimated value of R1.2 million. They also recovered a darting rifles and drugs, saws and knives, camping gear and rations and several cellphones. In October 2016 police seized assets at the Port Elizabeth luxury home of Jabulani Ndlovu, 38, a Zimbabwean citizen. Forget (40), also a ZImbabwean citizen, lives in Pacaltsdorp, George. Sikhumbuzo, 37, a South African, lives in Motherwell, Port Elizabeth. The men will appear again in Grahamstown next month, after the case was postponed for further investigation.
