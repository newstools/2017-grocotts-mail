Despite the enfeebling, scorching sun, school children still ran around the Monument confirming, &ldquo;Sifikile&rdquo; (we have arrived). Wednesday 8 March marked the beginning of the Scifest Africa. While some children played or bought snacks from the stalls outside, others eagerly stood in lines waiting to attend various presentations. There was a vast contradiction between the coordination of those inside and the disorganisation of their euphoric counterparts outside. Stellenbosch University Professor Bert Klumperman presented the first lecture at the Scifest. The Olive Schreiner Hall was filled with grade 10, 11 and 12 pupils, school teachers, university lecturers, a Scifest representative and journalists. In his presentation, Klumperman discussed the importance of polymers. He suggested that if the substance is made correctly, it could be used to in various products. One of its uses is in airplane doors to protect bullets from penetrating and harming passengers. His argument is that polymers are so much more than just plastic bags. Other lectures that day were presented by: Professor Shivani Mishra from Unisa, Bianka Reyneke from Welkom Gimnasium Secondary School and Maureen Seehawer from Oslo and Akershus University College in Norway. Scifest lectures continue until Tuesday 14 March.
