Leadership isn&rsquo;t a quality that belongs to any one organisation was the starting point of the first in a series of discussions about leadership facilitated by art activist and director of aroundhiphop, Xolile Madinda. &ldquo;In fact becoming a member of an organisation is the last stage in political awareness &ndash; not the first,&rdquo; Madinda told Grocott&rsquo;s Mail in an interview after the inaugural Quest for Leadership event, which took place in the city hall last Sunday afternoon. In a move that might have raised some eyebrows, first up in the series was former councillor Paul Notyawa, who is currently embroiled in a legal battle over the position of municipal manager in Makana Municipality. &ldquo;We understand that Notyawa is controversial at the moment,&rdquo; Madinda said in reply to a question from Grocott&rsquo;s Mail. &ldquo;But people have qualities outside of their working space. This person, an advocate by profession, has been very influential in the region. He&rsquo;s a former PEC member. He&rsquo;s served in the SACP and has been Cosatu&rsquo;s national spokesperson. It&rsquo;s important to share his experience.&rdquo;&nbsp; Madinda pointed to the example of Nelson Mandela. &ldquo;They had reservations after the fact - &ldquo;but in the end, you look at leadership&rdquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;Even the DA uses Mandela for their own benefit and no one questions it &ndash; but actually he acted on basis of resolutions taken at party conferences.&rdquo; Madinda said the series would use current leaders to stimulate a wider quest for future leadership. &ldquo;For us to shape society, we need to ask the hard questions,&rdquo; Madinda said. &ldquo;And these discussions don&rsquo;t have to happen at Rhodes among academics.&rdquo; While attendance on Sunday was a lot smaller than anticipated, those there represented a variety of perspectives. &ldquo;We have a system that is failing us as young people,&rdquo; a young woman said. &ldquo;We are all leaders, in our rightful positions, and leadership begins at home.&rdquo; A student from Eastcape Midlands College said there was no adequate preparation of young people to make them good leaders. He also criticised the lack of visibility of local leaders. A Grahamstown Residents Association representative said the organisation would like to see more of the workforce taking pride in Grahamstown. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the role of leadership to solve that problem &ndash; but they need support from managers and others. They need to be visible and set the tone, and others will fall in and respond.&rdquo; Madinda spoke of the need for &ldquo;mentoring the mind&rdquo; and the need to stimulate a thinking society that was not so easy to manipulate. &ldquo;People express too many opinions on Facebook &ndash; but the copy and paste mentality it fosters makes us disconnect from reality,&rdquo; Madinda said. Notyawa emphasised that discussion in the forum was not about taking a position, but putting forward ideas that allowed people to decide their own position. Madinda said all were welcome to participate in the next dialogue set for Human Rights Day, 21 March, at midday &ndash;venue to be confirmed. &ldquo;If you think you have something to offer, if see yourself as a leader in any field - economics, education etc &ndash; tell us what you can give.&rdquo; The offer of a venue would also be welcomed, Madinda said.
