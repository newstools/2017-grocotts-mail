&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here today because we have found out that there are some places here in Vukani which are not being taken care of,&rdquo; DA councillor Xolani Madyo told this citizen reporter. Six of the eight DA councillors along with 25 party activists spent Tuesday, Human Rights Day, cleaning up sewage leaks and picking up rubbish in the area. Jane Cowley and&nbsp;Fellow councillor Brian Fargher said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unacceptable that after two years, a leaking sewage pipe has not been fixed. We are cleaning up the mess. Sadly, if it were in town, it would have been solved very quickly.&rdquo; Resident Magogo Ntombizodwa Khongwana said, &ldquo;I see it as a great thing. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with what they are doing. They are encouraging the community. I am very thankful.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another resident, Umagogo Nomfusi Kamkam, said, &ldquo;I see it as a good thing because our children will be healthier. I encourage them.&rdquo; A mother living in the same street, Phindeka Honci, said, &ldquo;The DA members are cleaning up our area. We are very thankful because we&rsquo;ve been asking the municipality to help us with this sewage pipe which has been leaking for long time.&nbsp; Sakhumzi Nohesi, Ward 13 chairperson for the DA, said they had decided on the programme for human rights day.&nbsp; &ldquo;We think that the health of the people is important. The dignity of the people is shown where they are staying. That is why we decided on human rights day we must clean our area.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to say thank you very much to the people who supported us from all the different wards, including our members who were coming out of Grahamstown and Rhodes University students. Hands-on with help, too, was MEC and Frontier Constituency leader Jane Cowley. &ldquo;The DA members in Grahamstown make me very proud,&rdquo; Cowley said. &ldquo;They are very committed. &ldquo;This is South Africa for everybody, everyone must help, masincedane,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &bull; Lindani Donyeli is a citizen reporter who lives in Vukani and came across the DA group cleaning up in his area on&nbsp; Tuesday.
