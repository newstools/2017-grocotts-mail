The South African Banking Risk Information Centre (SABRIC) has alerted bank customers to a card-swapping scam. Kalyani Pillay, CEO of SABRIC said criminals use various ways to manipulate and distract ATM users in order to gain access to their bankcards and PINs &ldquo;and of course, ultimately, steal their money&rdquo;. In card swapping, while using an ATM, an unknown person will approach the victim and try to &ldquo;assist&rdquo; them. Their card will be taken out of the ATM by the criminal who presses the cancel button for the card to eject. It is then swapped without the bank customer realising it. The swap usually happens before the victim inserts their PIN to transact, which prevents the transaction from taking place due to the &ldquo;new&rdquo; swapped card being in the ATM. During this process of &ldquo;assisting&rdquo;, the fraudster is close enough to view the PIN. The victim will then leave the ATM after the unsuccessful transaction, either with someone else&rsquo;s card, or without their card which was apparently swallowed by the ATM. At the same time the criminal walks away with the victim&rsquo;s card and PIN, which will be utilised almost immediately at another nearby ATM.&nbsp; Criminals attempt to confuse bank customers, making them more inclined to accept assistance at ATMs by: &bull; Changing the language on ATM screen so that it looks unfamiliar to a customer, creating confusion; &bull; Activating the &ldquo;cardless function&rdquo; to change the way the display usually looks to disorientate a customer; &bull; Jamming the card slot or the pin pad of the ATM to lure a customer to a more remote ATM, around a corner, or short distance away. SABRIC says bank customers can protect themselves the following ways: &bull; If you think the ATM is faulty, cancel the transaction immediately, report the fault to your bank and transact at another ATM. &bull; Avoid ATMs that are dimly lit or surrounded by loiterers, and never allow your children to draw money using your card. &bull; Have your card ready in your hand before you approach the ATM. &bull; Follow the instructions on the ATM screen carefully. &bull; ONLY punch in your PIN once prompted by the ATM. &bull; Choose familiar and well-lit ATMs where you are visible and safe. &bull; Report any concerns regarding the ATM to the bank. Toll free numbers are displayed on all ATMs. &bull; Be alert to your surroundings. Do not use the ATM if there are loiterers or suspicious people in the vicinity. Fraudsters are often well-dressed, well-spoken and respectable looking. &nbsp;&bull; If you are disturbed while transacting, your card may be skimmed. Cancel the transaction immediately and report the incident using your Bank&#39;s Stop Card toll free number displayed on all ATMs and on the back of your bank card. &bull; Do not ask anyone to assist you at the ATM; not even the security personnel guarding the ATM. Rather go inside the bank for help. &bull; Never force your card into the slot as it might have been tampered with. &bull; Do not insert your card if the screen layout is not familiar to you and looks like the machine has been tampered with. &bull; Memorise your PIN, never write it down or share it with anyone, not even with a family member or a bank official. &bull; Don&rsquo;t let anyone stand too close to you. &bull; Set a daily withdrawal limit that suits your needs in the event that your card and PIN are compromised. &bull; Check your balance regularly and immediately report discrepancies to your bank. www.sabric.co.za
