Representatives of SA Rugby&rsquo;s BokSmart rugby safety programme and the Chris Burger Petro Jackson Players&rsquo; Fund (CBPJF) will join forces with a number of international rugby bodies at a Rugby Nations Workshop in Cape Town on Thursday and Friday (9 and 10 March), where post-injury player welfare and rugby safety matters will be placed under the spotlight. The closed two-day workshop, hosted by the Players&rsquo; Fund, will feature representatives from South Africa, England, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and Japan, and will include members of the respective Rugby Unions, Rugby Player&rsquo;s Funds and Rugby Safety programmes. The jam-packed programme will cover five core topics namely acute spinal cord injury challenges; effecting player welfare and rugby safety changes at ground zero; the &ldquo;near miss&rdquo; conundrum; how science and research can be used to effect change; and concussion and head trauma. The objectives of the workshop include (among others): &ldquo;Rugby safety and the prevention of catastrophic injuries is one of the main objectives for rugby federations world-wide, said SA Rugby&rsquo;s senior manager for Rugby Safety, Dr Wayne Viljoen. &ldquo;However, when things go wrong on the field, a focused and effective support strategy is hugely valuable to those catastrophically injured players. So we are delighted to join forces with the Players&rsquo; Fund and embark on this information-sharing practice with some of the other top rugby nations in the world. &ldquo;The structure of this workshop is unique in the sense that there are sections dedicated to vigorous discussions after each topical session, which will allow information sharing, learning and debate.&nbsp; This will then be captured into a closed report, meaning that everyone will walk away with something tangible, which will benefit us all. &ldquo;The fact that this workshop will involve a collaborative effort between a few top rugby nations is also significant, as it will assist in creating a pragmatic and more aligned approach to improving the effectiveness of rugby safety interventions, the treatment of concussion and catastrophic injuries, and equally important, player welfare post-injury.&rdquo; - SA Rugby Communications
