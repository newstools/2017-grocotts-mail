Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu says the government is working on laws to stop the sale of government subsidised houses. &ldquo;When (the government) gives a house to the needy, it is for the whole family and not for one person. No one must sell the house. It must be passed from generation to generation,&rdquo; said Sisulu. The Minister was opening the North West Human Settlements Indaba on Thursday. From April 2017, the national government will implement a National Housing Needs Register (NHNR), which is a centralised database of all those who require housing assistance in the country. &ldquo;Currently we are processing all waiting lists from municipalities to ensure that we have a credible national centralised database. We want to ensure that there is credibility in the process of allocating houses,&rdquo; said Sisulu. The Minister said she is working with all provincial MECs of Human Settlements to ensure all contractors and materials suppliers are paid within 30 days. &ldquo;I have told my Director-General that small contractors and small businesses must be prioritised at all times. If they do not have capacity to process the necessary documents, they must be assisted. We must pay our service providers within 30 days. They need the money to pay their workers,&rdquo; Sisulu said.&nbsp; &ndash; SAnews.gov.za
