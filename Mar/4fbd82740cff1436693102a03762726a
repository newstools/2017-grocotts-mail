The annual Makana Brick 8km Nite Race attracted over 700 participants, with proceeds &nbsp;going to Grahamstown Hospice.&nbsp; The event started and finished at the Graeme College Somerset Field. Participants made their way past Kingswood College, St Andrew&rsquo;s College, DSG and St Andrew&rsquo;s Prep before returning to Somerset Field. &nbsp; Masixolo Xayiya had to make his way through the mass start, before taking the lead until the finish. He stopped the watch on 28 minutes exactly, with Sisa Camagu finishing second and Lubabalo Bokuva third.&nbsp; The women&rsquo;s was a closer race, with Lauren Ranger leading for most of the way. DSG pupil, Kendal Rose took the lead a few hundred metres from the finish to cross the line in 32:44, with Ranger finishing four seconds adrift.&nbsp; Terri-Lynn Penney finished third with Jene Banfield fourth. Each finisher received a pineapple, while most finishers received a medal and some were lucky enough to win a spot prize as well. Participants came from all corners of Grahamstown to support the race, which has become a favourite for residents and a must-do for local athletes. Local schools were once again well- represented, while many students also took to the field. St Andrew&rsquo;s and Kingswood pupils each operated a water table along the route, while school pupils and Rhodes University Varsity Shield players helped with marshalling duties.
