Water restrictions will remain in place in parts of the Eastern Cape until dam levels average 80% of their capacity, the Department of Water and Sanitation announced today at a media briefing in King William&#39;s Town, as low water levels in the Eastern Cape Water Supply System (ECWSS) raise serious concerns for water security in the province for the next year or two.&nbsp; &quot;Major dams that supply the ECWSS have dropped their levels substantially in the past year by 9.2% and the reduction has continued at between 0.1% and 1% a week,&quot; the Department said in a statement issued after the briefing. According to a report by the Department of Water and Sanitation released this week on dam levels, the average combined levels for the ECWSS is 63.6%. This is a notable decline as compared to 72.8% the same time in 2016.&nbsp; &quot;In general, despite the Eastern Cape dams being at the lowest levels after many years, there is still adequate storage provided that consumers adhere to the water conservation request,&quot; the Department said. &quot;The department is busy with a number of water projects as part of improving service delivery.&quot; The Department announced backup measures to harvest and conserve water. It named as possible additional water sources: &bull; Recycling of water &bull; Drilling of boreholes where there is significant potential in ground water. &bull; Desalination &bull; Implementing water conservation and demand management programmes which include the War on Leaks and Drop the Block interventions. The Department said it was looking at augmenting water schemes, for example the Nooitgedacht water scheme in Nelson Mandela Bay.&nbsp; &quot;To further curb excessive water use, the government has put into effect the 15% water restrictions in certain parts of the province. The water restrictions will remain intact until the dams fill up to over 80% of their capacity.&nbsp; &quot;The province is still experiencing drought, but this should not in any way compel people to sell rationed water because that amounts to corruption,&quot; the Department said. &quot;South Africa has been rated among the 30 driest countries in the world that run the risk of becoming a desert unless its citizens start saving water earnestly. &quot;As part of its awareness campaign, the department has declared March as Water Month and we appeal to everyone to use water wisely and efficiently during this month and beyond.&quot; * WATER IN FOCUS: Grocott&#39;s Mail will publish a special supplement next Friday, in our 17 March edition, ahead of National Water Week, 20-26 March.
