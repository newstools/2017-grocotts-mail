While Rhodes campus unions Nehawu and NTEU have formed a joint bargaining collective in this year&rsquo;s wave of industrial action, the demands they presented during a mass march to the University&rsquo;s main administration building this week differed in emphasis. In separate memorandums presented to members of the University management on the clock tower steps during a lunchtime picket on Tuesday, the National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union demanded a 7% across the board increase, while the National Tertiary Education Union declared 7.5% as their lower limit. Along with increases in housing, transport and danger allowances for eligible staff, Nehawu&rsquo;s demands include the changing of the institution&rsquo;s name, an end to outsourcing and retrenchments, and the naming and shaming of departments that don&rsquo;t meet equity standards. NTEU listed a reduction in the working week from 40 to 37.5 hours and the extension of a 50% medical subsidy to retired employees among their demands. Both unions called for a 100% tuition subsidy for employees&rsquo; family members and the means for workers to upgrade their careers through training and certification. Speaking for NTEU, shop steward Ryno van Rooyen said with inflation at 6.5% and food inflation in January at 11.4%, a five percent increase was a wage cut in real terms. He cited Statistics SA&rsquo;s calculation that in Grahamstown, on average, each wage supports 44 people. Many of the picketers carried placards saying, &ldquo;My wage supports my community.&rdquo; Transformation was high on Nehawu&rsquo;s agenda, with regional organiser of the union&rsquo;s Max Madlingozi region, Lusindiso Mbutsi, calling for the abolishment of the lower-paying grades, 1, 2 and 3. &ldquo;Where have you seen a grey-headed man taking home R1 000 at the end of the day,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Employment must start at Grade 4 and those without the requisite skills must be assisted by the university to obtain them.&rdquo; The harmonisation of rates of pay was to be pursued, Mbutsi said, and the university&rsquo;s name should be changed to that of &ldquo;someone with whom all at the university can identify&rdquo;. Nehawu stipulated seven days in which the university should respond. Speaking in support of the industrial action were Sasco chairperson Nhlakanipho Mahlangu and secretary general Enkosi Ntwana. &ldquo;You are our parents and we&rsquo;ve struggled through with you last year when we protested for our fees to fall because our parents can&rsquo;t afford them,&rdquo; Ntwana said. &ldquo;We had a journey of students getting arrested and beaten up for no reason. But we [too] were only looking to receive the word that our demands have been met.&rdquo; Facing the gathering of around 400 on the steps of Rhodes University&rsquo;s main administration building and listening to the demands were Deputy Vice-Chancellor: Academic and Student Affairs Professor Chrissie Boughey and Dr Iain L&rsquo;Ange, Executive Director - Infrastructure, Finance and Operations along with Peter Clayton, deputy vice chancellor: Research and Development, who received and signed the memorandums. Clayton explained that the reason for Vice Chancellor Dr Sizwe Mabizela&rsquo;s absence was that he was in Cape Town at that time, meeting with funders. Classes were not interrupted during Tuesday&rsquo;s industrial action; however, dining halls were closed and students living in residence received e-wallet payments in lieu of meals. In a statement following Tuesday&rsquo;s industrial action, the university&rsquo;s communications division said it expected that the negotiations between management and the unions would resume as soon as possible and that agreement would be reached at the earliest opportunity. &ldquo;In this regard, the University remains committed to constructive, open and transparent engagement with organised labour.&rdquo; Mabizela acknowledged the memorandum and said, &ldquo;We accept that an increase of 5% is a bitter pill to swallow in the face of biting inflation. We however continue to engage in good faith and with complete transparency. We hope to be able to find a workable solution in the shortest time possible.&rdquo; &bull;Additional reporting by&nbsp;Kamogelo Hlokzen
