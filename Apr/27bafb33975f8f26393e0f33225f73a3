Triple Grammy-nominated South African pianist Petronel Malan will perform at Rhodes University this week. Malan&nbsp;maintains a full performance schedule as recitalist, orchestral soloist and chamber musician in major venues throughout the world. After her European debut in Rome, further highlights have included Carnegie Recital Hall, Th&eacute;&acirc;tre du Ch&acirc;telet &amp; Salle Cortot (Paris), Mozarteum (Salzburg), Liszt Museum (Budapest), Orchestra Hall (Chicago), Alte Handelsb&ouml;rse (Leipzig), Bass Hall (Fort Worth), as well as the Ravinia, Gilmore &amp; Music in the Mountain Festivals. Petronel has appeared with orchestras such as the St. Petersburg State (Russia), Martin&uacute; (Czech Republic), Bucaramanga (Colombia), Batumi (Republic of Georgia), Sicilian Chamber (Italy), and several others in the US and South Africa, under the batons of Vasily Petrenko, Bernhard Gueller, Karina Canellakis, Dmitry Manilov, Yoshimi Takeda, James Brooks, Robert Hanson, and Fuzao Kajima. Her&nbsp;career was launched following five gold medals in 2000 at international piano competitions throughout the US. Born in South Africa, Petronel began lessons with her mother at age four, continuing with Adolph Hallis, Joseph Stanford and Albie van Schalkwyk. She debuted with the Johannesburg Symphony at age 10&nbsp;and subsequently won all major national competitions, before moving to the United States. Petronel completed both her graduate degrees at the University of North Texas. Her teachers included Steven de Groote, Ralph Votapek and Joseph Banowetz and intensive coaching sessions from American legend Earl Wild. Although&nbsp;living in the US, Malan continues strong ties to her native South Africa. She received the &ldquo;Rapport/City Press Prestige Award&rdquo; as one of the 10 Most Inspirational Women in South Africa, and has appeared on magazine covers, fashion spreads and even as picture-clues in crossword puzzles. She was awarded both a&nbsp;KKNK Kanna&nbsp;and a&nbsp;KykNET Fiesta&nbsp;awards for her live performances in South Africa. Apart from a love for vintage gowns, Malan&rsquo;s stage wardrobe is designed by foremost South African designers. A frequent speaker and promoter of classical music in schools, scholarships in her name are awarded to promising young musicians. Rhodes University will be hosting this outstanding artist, performing works by Brahms, Mozart, Beethoven, and Rachmaninoff on&nbsp;Wednesday, 26 April 2016 at 7.30pm&nbsp;in the Beethoven Room.&nbsp;Tickets are available at the door:&nbsp;R100 adults, R50 concessions.
