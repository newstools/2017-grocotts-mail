Makana Municipality&rsquo;s recruitment process for the appointment of a municipal manager has been halted, following a court ruling in favour of former councillor Paul Notyawa. The High Court on Monday handed down a temporary interdict pending the outcome of a review application in the matter between Notyawa and Makana Municipality and the MEC for Cogta in the Eastern Cape. Notyawa lodged court papers in February this year that seek to have the court declare he was lawfully appointed in the post of municipal manager on 12 March 2015. Chief respondents in the matter are Makana Municipality and the MEC for Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs in the Eastern Cape. Acting Municipal Manager in Makana Municipality Mandisi Planga yesterday confirmed the interdict. &ldquo;What this simply means is that the municipality cannot appoint a MM pending the review application that will be heard around June 2017,&rdquo; Planga said. &ldquo;Thus the recruitment process that had already been started will be put in abeyance.&rdquo; He said Makana would continue to oppose Notyawa&rsquo;s bid to be instated in the position of municipal manager. Attorney Mike van der Veen of Wheeldon Rushmere and Cole yesterday confirmed that the firm was in the process of submitting a review application in the matter. He said they had yesterday filed replying documents to Makana Municipality, however second respondent, the MEC for Co-operative Governance, had not yet filed any papers.
