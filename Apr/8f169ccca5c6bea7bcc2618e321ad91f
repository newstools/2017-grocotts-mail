No injuries have been reported and no foul play is suspected. The house next door to the factory, number 2B burnt down along with the garden flat and mechanical workshop of Jenino Burgess. Burgess&rsquo;s four cars took fire and exploded. Machines, car parts and compressors were destroyed. Early this morning, there were still a few flames and smoke. The Burgess family are traumatised and in shock. Community members tried to help stop the flames, but the fire was uncontrollable, spread quickly by strong winds. Birch&rsquo;s employees who arrived on the scene were in shock, some in tears. Neighbours and friends arrived to help the Burgess family next door, whose house caught fire and was gutted. Kurt Solomon, whose auto-repair business KS Auto is nearby, was among those who came with tow trucks to remove vehicles parked in the yard. Jenino repairs cars. &ldquo;Everybody gave a hand, helping the family remove their possessions from the house to safety,&rdquo; Solomon said. Early this morning Friday 14 April Makana fire chief Willliam Welkom confirmed the fire was under control. He confirmed the damage to the Birch&rsquo;s Factory and a house. &ldquo;The fire was very intense. All other adjacent properties were protected. In response to rumours on social media that a &ldquo;college&rdquo; had burned, Welkom said. &ldquo;No college or school was burned.&rdquo; Welkom also confirmed that no injuries were reported. He said the Army fire unit assisted, and Rhodes University brought their water tanker. &ldquo;The fire crew remained at the scene to extinguish the smouldering debris inside the factory and house. This will continue today to completely extinguish the fire,&rdquo; Welkom said. &ldquo;A total of three fire engines, the Rhodes water tanker and an Army fire engine were in operation during the fire. The cause of the fire is not yet determined.&rdquo; Welkom is the Assistant Director of Makana Fire and Rescue Services. SAPS spokesperson Captain Mali Govender said no criminal case was being investigated in connection with the fire. She said police were called to the scene around 6pm last night, Thursday 13 April. &ldquo;Buildings and vehicles were gutted. At this stage no foul play is suspected. The cause of the fire is still to be determined. No criminal case is being investigated,&rdquo; Govender said. Birch&rsquo;s factory manager Andre van Reenen declined to comment regarding last night&rsquo;s fire. He referred&nbsp;Grocott&rsquo;s Mail&nbsp;to the company&rsquo;s Port Elizabeth offices, saying they would comment only after Tuesday. A Birch&rsquo;s employee, however, said &ldquo;a lot&rdquo; of stock was destroyed and that managers had been at the site to assess the damage. * Note: Chesley Daniels, who co-reported this incident, did so with difficulty, as he lost six family members when their home, metres away from the Birch&rsquo;s factory, caught fire on 31 May 2004.
