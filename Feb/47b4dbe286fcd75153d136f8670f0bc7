Grahamstown swimmers, Martin Wolmarans and Shaelyn Walker finished 14th and 16th respectively in the men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s 3km open water swimming at Marina Martinique on Sunday 5 February. Martin finished the Nelson Mandela Bay Aquatics (NMBA) 3km Championship race in 43 minutes 45 second, while Shaelyn finished in 45:12.
