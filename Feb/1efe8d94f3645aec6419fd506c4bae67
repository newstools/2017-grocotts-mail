Tourism is one of the few sectors that can create jobs and is inclusive of communities, especially when it concerns cultural and heritage tourism. Makana Tourism is inviting stakeholders to participate in a process which aims to: &bull; Identify individual projects in and around Grahamstown East; and&nbsp; &bull; Determine how to package these projects for tourists and visitors who are interested in experiencing our culture at its best. &ldquo;This process is not meant to dilute the existing initiatives already in place such as Fingo Festival or Kwam eMakana, but rather to use them as a base for township tourism development and, ultimately, community building,&rdquo; director Sue Waugh said. &ldquo;It is hoped that eKasi Tourism would become a route or a series of themed routes with an activity or several activities in each extension.&rdquo; Waugh cited the example of the tours around Soweto which allow visitors to experience its rich political history and trendsetting culture.&nbsp; And the initiative in Alexandra Township in Johannesburg, which recently launched their &lsquo;Cocktails and Culinary Delicacies in Alex&rsquo;.&nbsp; The four-hour tour takes guests on a journey of Alexandra through food and is provided every weekend, from Friday through Sunday.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no reason why iRhini cannot produce a similar or better concept,&rdquo; said Waugh.
