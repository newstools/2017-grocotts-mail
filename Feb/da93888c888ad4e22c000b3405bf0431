Have you ever sung in a choir? Perhaps you&#39;ve even sung in Handel&#39;s Messiah before? It&#39;s the dream of co-director Priscilla Glover to have 1 000 singers sing The Hallelujah Chorus from The Messiah at Masicule 2017 at the Monument on 19 and 20 March. Masicule this year features 400 voices from Grahamstown schools and star acts include Asanda Mqiki from The Soil and local a capella group, Signature Sound. This year, a special feature of the annual massed choir event is The Hallelujah Chorus, with orchestra, both under the baton of Victoria Girls&#39; High School choirmaster S&#39;bu Mkhize. And they&#39;re looking for singers. You do need to have sung in a choir, says Glover, and although it&#39;s an advantage to have sung Handel&#39;s Messiah before, it&#39;s not a prerequisite. &quot;Please come and join us,&quot; Glover said. If you&#39;d like to be part of the 400-plus-voice choir for the Hallelujah Chorus please contact Priscilla Glover at p.glover@graemecollege.co.za or 082 576 7227. If you play an instrument and can read music then why not join the orchestra? The orchestra is being co-ordinated by Kingswood College Music School and to play in it, you should contact Alke Bradfield at a.bradfield@kingswoodcollege.com or 046 603 6670. Please note that the Hallelujah Chorus will be performed in the key of C Major instead of the D Major in which it is written. This is because of the &quot;very high notes for our young sopranos,&quot; Glover said. Rehearsals are - at Nombulelo Secondary School: Sunday 26 February, 2pm-4pm (learning notes) Sunday 5 and Sunday 12 March, 2pm-4pm At the Monument: Thursday 16 March, 7.30pm-9.30pm Sunday 19 March, 1.30pm (dress rehearsal). Masicule performances are on Sunday 19 March at 4pm and Monday 20 March at 7.30pm. Masicule 2017 is directed by Gareth Walwyn and Priscilla Glover.
