In an attempt to connect with the largest cross-section of Makana residents, we have been using the local airwaves (Radio Grahamstown) on Wednesday mornings between 9am and 12pm.&nbsp; We shall soon be on Rhodes Music Radio (RMR) too. &nbsp; MobiSAM urges all residents to connect with us, as we look to extend our reach and build awareness of your (residents&#39;) roles and responsibilities with regard to holding public officials accountable and monitoring service delivery in Makana.&nbsp; We are predominantly Facebook and SMS for now, until the launch of the MobiSAM App in early March. Acting on data gathered during a 2016 baseline study of the communication practices of residents across the municipality, we were pleased to be reminded of the socio-economic and cultural diversity in Makana.&nbsp; In a bid to address the various levels of access to information and use of the local media channels that people rely on, MobiSAM has partnered with local stakeholders as well as the municipally-managed ward war rooms.&nbsp; These strategic partnerships have allowed the project to connect with people from City Hall and the bustling CBD to Extension 7 and all the way to Riebeeck East. Working alongside the Grahamstown Residents Association, UpStart Youth, the Unemployed People&rsquo;s Movement, Umthathi Training Project and the various departments at Makana Municipality, has also allowed us to build networks of communication which has improved the flow of information between all the stakeholders in preparation of the launch of our application.&nbsp; We are currently training both our team of ward liaisons and the communications team at the Municipality in using the technology that we hope will facilitate more communication and greater accountability. The collaboration between Makana,&nbsp;MobiSAM and especially the queries and complaints by citizens is key to creating more awareness of service delivery issues which impact all residents of Makana.
