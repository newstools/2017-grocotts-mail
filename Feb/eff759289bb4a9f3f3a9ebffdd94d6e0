Grahamstown based aerobics club, Makana Aerobics and Fitness Club holds sessions weekly at the New Indoor Sport Centre in Extension 6 from Monday to Thursday, 6pm to 7pm. Andisa Bonani, club marketing officer and Zimkhitha Mngxuma, event coordinator, said they already had a calendar of events for the year, starting with one on Saturday 11 February. Bonani said the club planned to hold quarterly programmes such as athletics, and running events ranging from 5km to 21km, should they have their licence to host as a club.&nbsp; Bonani said they planned to officially launch the club on 24 September 2017. They encourage Grahamstown youth to do gym not only as a tool to lose weight, but as a healthy lifestyle. Bonani further explained that aerobics is an activity not only for women and girls, but men and boys too. &quot;We have people of all sizes here, from chubby to slim. They come for wellness and a natural fitness,&quot; said Bonani. Mngxuma said the club had established an executive committee to keep the administration side running smoothly. All the executive members are volunteers. No one is getting paid and no one owns the club &ndash; &ldquo;It belongs to the community.&rdquo; The fee for membership is R100 a month, which is used to develop the club and keep aerobics going. &quot;We visited Bloemfontein, where they value their aerobics, and witnessed different routines,&quot; said Mngxuma. &quot;The Department of Sports, Recreation, Arts and Culture does support our programmes. We also get sponsorship from Sanlam, Old Mutual and the local Tavern, Mfanandini.&quot; The club is also facing a shortage of mats, steps and sound equipment. They are trying to persuade members of different Grahamstown communities to join the club, emphasising that anyone can take over when the current executive commitee members step down.
