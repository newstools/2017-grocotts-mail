The poor state of roads in Riebeeck East has been a concern for Makana Municipality. However, the municipality is happy to announce that with funding from the Department of Roads and Transport to the tune of R3 million, it has been able to commence with a paving project in the area.&nbsp; The issue of degraded internal roads in Riebeeck East has been a great worry for the residents of that small town. As planned for in the 2016/2017 financial year, Makana Municipality has embarked on an upgrade of the internal roads around the township that will see a stretch of about 1 000km being upgraded.&nbsp; The project started in September 2016 and it is anticipated to be completed within five months (end of March), weather permitting.&nbsp; A decision was taken during a Council meeting that the municipality should consider paving instead of tarring surface roads, as it is more sustainable and more easily maintained.&nbsp; Makana Municipality appointed Lesiso Construction and the contractor has already commenced work on site for the upgrade. In a town with a high unemployment rate, this project has seen at least 14 locals being employed.&nbsp; Among them are 12 general workers, one construction liaison officer and a security guard.&nbsp; The project is funded by Department of Roads and Transport, and is costing R3 million.&nbsp; The community of Riebeeck East expressed their gratitude to the municipality, saying it was difficult for pedestrians and motor vehicle drivers to travel around the township, as the roads were in a very bad state.&nbsp; &ldquo;We thank the municipality for listening to our cries. I see this as the beginning of more beautiful things to come. They have even considered our own children for employment,&rdquo; said Mrs Mbali, a community member.&nbsp; These employees are also receiving training in paving in the process.&nbsp; &bull; Makana Municipality is delighted at the opportunity to showcase positive news about the institution in the form&nbsp;of a monthly column in&nbsp;Grocott&rsquo;s Mail.&nbsp;The column is meant to inform the residents of &nbsp;Makana about the&nbsp;municipality&rsquo;s positive achievements, which include projects, events, issues of public interest and other service&nbsp;delivery matters. &nbsp;&nbsp;
