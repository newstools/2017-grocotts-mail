The Women&#39;s Association of the Makanaskop Uniting Presbyterian Church this week handed over 10 brand-new school uniforms to needy children at Grahamstown&#39;s DD Siwisa Primary School. The donation was part of the Association&#39;s Back To School campaign and the children were identified by the school&#39;s teachers.&nbsp;
