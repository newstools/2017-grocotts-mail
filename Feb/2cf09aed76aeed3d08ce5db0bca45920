Economics honours student Jonathan Braans will captain the FNB Rhodes University Varsity Shield team in its historic debut season in the national student competition which kicks off on 9 February against FNB TUT in Pretoria. Braans, one of the few players left from the group that secured Varsity Shield qualification, said he was honoured to be given the responsibility of leading Rhodes University during the Varsity Shield.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a fantastic privilege to be the captain of FNB Rhodes,&rdquo; Braans said. &ldquo;When Coach Qondakele [Sompondo] told me it came as a surprise, but it is a responsibility that I am looking forward to.&rdquo;&nbsp; Braans matriculated from Kingswood College in 2012 and enjoyed many sporting achievements during his school days.&nbsp; He played for the Kingswood first cricket and rugby sides in 2011 and 2012 and received school colours for both sports at the end of his matric year.&nbsp; He is no stranger to leadership roles, having captained the Kingswood 1st XV Rugby side in 2012 to great success.&nbsp; Braans expects a tough campaign for the d&eacute;butantes but is adamant they have prepared well and are ready to compete.&nbsp; &ldquo;We know how tough it is going to be as the new boys in the competition: our heads are going to be on the block each week. But we know we have prepared well for this competition,&rdquo; Braans said. Head coach Sompondo spoke highly of the captain&rsquo;s leadership qualities.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jono is one of the most hard-working and determined guys I&rsquo;ve coached,&quot; Sompondo said. &quot;He leads from the front and his work rate on and off the field is phenomenal.&rdquo; The side have played two warm-up games, against FNB Fort Hare Blues and the Grahamstown Brumbies, in their preparations for the Varsity Shield.&nbsp; They first take on FNB TUT in Pretoria on 9 February before they welcome fellow new boys FNB CPUT at the Rhodes Great Field on 13 February.
