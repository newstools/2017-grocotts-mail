While on camp in Port Alfred, the Southern Kings took some time out to hold a coaching clinic for school children from the Ndlambe Municipality on Thursday (2 February) afternoon. Following a positive pre-season camp, the side ended their final training session in Port Alfred by imparting their skills to groups of school children who had eagerly watched the Southern Kings go through their paces for the duration of their last training session before the team moved on to East London. Close to a hundred boys and girls gathered at Station Hill Stadium where they enjoyed an afternoon of fun and training from the Southern Kings and coaches, while school and club coaches gained some coaching wisdom from Southern Kings head coach Deon Davids. &ldquo;It is a privilege for us as the Southern Kings team to be able to spend some time with the children and coaches. We do hope that they have learnt from us. We also do hope that the kids will continue working hard and listen to their coaches and teachers. These are the future Kings,&rdquo; Davids said. Southern Kings COO Charl Crous handed over rugby balls to the community to ensure that the game of rugby continues to grow in the area. Chief whip of the Ndlambe municipality Andile Malgas and ward councillor Mbulelo Jibane were excited about the coaching clinic, and expressed their gratitude for the donation. &ldquo;We would like to thank the Southern Kings for utilising our town as a sports tourism destination. Most importantly, we are grateful that our own rugby team is embracing our communities and ensuring that the game of rugby continues to develop. We would like to stress that the Southern Kings enjoy our full support, and we will be flocking to the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium to show our support,&rdquo; Malgas said. The Southern Kings held another coaching clinic for school children in East London, at the Hamiltons Rugby Club on Saturday.
