South Africa&rsquo;s premier off-road triathlon, the Fedhealth XTERRA heads to Kings Beach (Nelson Mandela Bay) this coming weekend (Friday, 10 February 2017 &ndash; Sunday, 12 February 2017). Kicking off with the Fedhealth XTERRA Kids on the Friday, followed by the Fedhealth XTERRA Full on the Saturday and the Fedhealth XTERRA Lite and XTERRA Trail Run on the Sunday, there is an event for athletes of all ages and fitness levels. In 2016 Michael Ferreira claimed gold in the men&rsquo;s Fedhealth XTERRA Lite completing the 400m swim, 12km mountain bike discipline and 6km trail run in an impressive combined time of 1 hour 11 minutes 19 seconds. &ldquo;I enjoyed the new venue,&rdquo; says Ferreira.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was really cool to race so close to a city, especially being the city that I grew up in.&nbsp; The ocean swim added a new dimension to XTERRA racing.&nbsp; The mountain bike route was a good mixture of urban style and classic cross country mountain biking.&nbsp; The run route was amazing.&nbsp; Running through Happy Valley was very interesting because it went from the sunny beach to dense forest in a blink of an eye.&nbsp; The people and the venue make XTERRA an incredible experience.&rdquo; &ldquo;The XTERRA Lite is a good introduction to the sport of XTERRA,&rdquo; continues Ferreira.&nbsp; &ldquo;The course is of such a nature that the faster you go the harder it gets.&nbsp; Newcomers to the sport can take it slow and it will be a fun, easy race to participate in.&rdquo; This coming weekend Michael Ferreira will be seen in action in the Fedhealth XTERRA Full in Nelson Mandela Bay. Natia Van Heerden was the female athlete to beat in the 2016 Fedhealth XTERRA Lite Nelson Mandela Bay claiming gold in an impressive combined time of 1 hour 24 minutes 50 seconds.&nbsp; &ldquo;Winning was an amazing feeling,&rdquo; said Van Heerden.&nbsp; &ldquo;XTERRA tests you in every way.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s great to have a sea swim and beach run as it pushes you even more.&rdquo; EVENT INFORMATION:&nbsp; Fedhealth XTERRA Nelson Mandela Bay / Kings Beach (Eastern Cape) &nbsp; Date: Event: Friday, 10 February 2017 Fedhealth XTERRA Kids &nbsp; 6-8 years (60m Swim, 2km Cycle, 600m Run) &nbsp; 9-11 years (100m Swim, 3km MTB, 1.5km Trail Run) &nbsp; 12-15 years (250m Swim, 5km MTB, 2.5km Trail Run) Saturday, 11 February 2017 Fedhealth XTERRA Full:&nbsp; 1.5km swim, 24.5km MTB, 9.7km trail run Sunday, 12 February 2017 XTERRA Trail Run:&nbsp; 9.7km and 4.9km Sunday, 12 February 2017 Fedhealth XTERRA Lite:&nbsp; 400m swim, 12km&nbsp; MTB, 4.9km trail run &nbsp; Next on the XTERRA SA Calendar: &nbsp; Friday, 24 February 2017 &ndash; Sunday, 26 February 2017 Fedhealth XTERRA Grabouw / SA Championship &nbsp; EXCITING NEWS ~ Fedhealth members will be pleased to hear that they can enter free of charge by typing in their Fedhealth membership number when entering on line.
