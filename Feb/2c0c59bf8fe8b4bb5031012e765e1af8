Cacadu Development Agency CEO Mlungisi Mvoko would add value and capacity to the Eastern Cape government&rsquo;s leadership, says ANC regional secretary Scara Njadayi, and could help the party redeem its tattered reputation &ndash; at least in the Province. Njadayi&rsquo;s statement comes five months ahead of the party&rsquo;s provincial conference &ndash; in turn just three days before its National Policy Conference &ndash; and around three weeks before the branch general meetings, where members will put forward the names of their preferred candidates. Mvoko is the chairperson of the ANC&rsquo;s Sarah Baartman Region and is in his third term of office in that position.&nbsp; However, it is not the regional structure but local branches that will determine whose names are put forward for the provincial leadership. &ldquo;Succession has not yet been opened,&rdquo; Njadayi said, &ldquo;so we can&rsquo;t pronounce on the provincial leadership. &ldquo;As a region we will be guided by our branches; however, we want to be credibly represented in the leadership of the province.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;As the region, we have leaders whom we think could lead us very well at a provincial level. They could provide some good solutions in to some of the complex challenges confronting the African National Congress.&rdquo; The basis of leadership discussions, Njadayi said, was the capacity of an individual to help the ANC in redeem its integrity in the public domain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Second, we will consider individuals who can advance and stick to the values and culture of the African National Congress.&rdquo; The region wasn&rsquo;t short of good leaders, Njadayi said. &ldquo;However, our view at the Regional Executive Committee (REC) level is that there should be a consideration for Comrade Mlungisi Mvoko to be placed on list for nomination to the Provincial Executive Committee.&rdquo; Mvoko is currently the Sarah Baartman ANC REC Chairperson and Njadayi said they would persuade ANC branches and try to lobby other regions to support him for a position in the province. He said Mvoko is an intellectual and is well capacitated administratively, politically, ideologically and in other ways. &ldquo;We are confident that he can provide solutions to some of the problematic areas in the ANC. But beyond that, our view is that Comrade Mvoko led the South African Local Government Association and was the Sarah Baartman region&rsquo;s ever youngest secretary. &ldquo;He knows finances, economics and local government extensively. So we are not just bargaining on someone we not sure about. We are supporting an individual whom we know is excellent in political leadership and administrative capacity.&rdquo; The branch general meetings are set to follow branch audits on 15 February, and formally it is only then that discussions about succession in the Province begin and Mvoko, a former member of the Provincial Executive Committee of the South African Local Government Association, is for that reason cautious about commenting. Mvoko said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the process that would determine, but for me I can&rsquo;t say something before the region&rsquo;s pronouncement. That would mean I&rsquo;m dividing the same region that I&rsquo;m leading. &ldquo;If the branches want me then I have no alternative but to do that. The region would sit down and say what are the implications of doing this. If branches and regions agree on that then I won&rsquo;t &nbsp;say no. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say no if branches want me to go to the province, but I want to know that I have support from the regions,&rdquo; said Mvoko.
