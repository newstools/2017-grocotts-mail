Performances and workshops by uhadi traditional bow player Madosini will be one of the highlights of the Puku Story Festival in Grahamstown, 21-26 February. The homegrown festival with its roots in Grahamstown celebrates isiXhosa language and culture in general - and literature in particular. Kicking off on 21 February in Joza&#39;s Noluthando Hall, the Festival celebrates International Mother Tongue Day with and afternoon of entertainment that includes a spelling bee. Wednesday 22 February will see the Festival on the road, visiting farm schools in the area for storytelling and games facilitated by Grahamstown celebrity - stand-up comic Tsepiso Nzayo. The Festival then moves to the National English Literary Museum (NELM), where an all-day exhibition on Thursday 23 February will feature isiXhosa children&#39;s books. Exhibitors include publishers, NGOs and environmental organisations. There will be storytelling and games in the NELM amphitheatre (don&#39;t worry - if the weather&#39;s very hot or very wet, the area will be covered!) from 9am to 11.30am on Thursday, featuring Madosini, Pedro Espi Sanchez and others. Authors Sindiwe Magona and Elinor Sisulu, Grocott&#39;s Mail&#39;s own &#39;Licence to Write&#39; poet Hleze Kunju, and Nzayo are among the others on the programme over the next four days, during which the feature film IIntonga will also be screened. DON&#39;T MISS MAKANA SHARP!
