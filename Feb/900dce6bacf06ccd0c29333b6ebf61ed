The third edition of the Concert in the Dark, raising funds for the St John&#39;s Eye Clinic, will take place next Friday (3 March) at 7.30pm in the Kingswood College Chapel. On the programme are chamber music for violin, clarinet, flute, piano and more from a variety of composers including Baroque composer, Georg Philipp Telemann, and modern composers, Ian Clarke, Antoni Szalowski and Edwin Roxburgh.&nbsp; The performers include the Kingswood College music teachers and Grade 12 musicians, Maka Makoni, Georgia Cadle and Emily Fryer.&nbsp; The audience quite literally listens to the music in the dark - a gesture of respect for those with impaired vision, many of whom are served by the St John&#39;s Eye Clinic. All are welcome. Entry is by donation with all funds going to the Clinic.&nbsp; For more information contact Alke Bradfield at a.bradfield@kingswoodcollege.com or 046 603 6670
