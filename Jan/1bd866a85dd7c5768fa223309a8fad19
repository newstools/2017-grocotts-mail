Only 15 months after reopening, the Royal St Andrew&#39;s Hotel in Port Alfred has been ranked fourth among the tripadvisor 2017 Travellers Choice top 25 hotels in South Africa. It is listed ahead of the likes of Cape Town&rsquo;s Queen Victoria Hotel, The Table Bay Hotel and One&amp;Only Hotel, as well as the Saxon in Gauteng, and Fancourt in the Western Cape. Comments by guests on tripadvisor include &ldquo;Lovely family and conference hotel,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Great week-end away&rdquo;. &ldquo;To share the top five ranking with the likes of the Oyster Box in Umhlanga Rocks, the Kapama River Lodge in Limpopo and Cape Grace in Cape Town is a real boost for tourism in Port Alfred,&rdquo; says owner Martin Bekker. &ldquo;The fact that we enjoyed over 60 per cent occupancy during our second December season since opening shows that there is a demand for up-market accommodation in Port Alfred,&rdquo; says general manager Wessel Benson. He believes that the ranking will attract more tourists to the Sunshine Coast.&nbsp; &ldquo;When people see the ranking, one of the first things they do is to find out what there is to do in the vicinity of the hotel. &ldquo;That is when travellers discover &ndash; or rediscover &ndash; just how much there is to do in Port Alfred and surrounds,&rdquo; says Benson. Having an up-market hotel in the town is also helping it to secure corporate events such as car launches and conferences. A multi-million rand investment by Bekker transformed the historic 10-room Royal St Andrew&#39;s Lodge built in 1924 into a 60-room up-market hotel and conference centre which blends tradition with modern design. It is also home to three restaurants &ndash; the Highlander pub catering for the whole family, the fine dining Thistle Restaurant and the Paper Nautilus Deli, which has become a favourite breakfast and function venue in Port Alfred. The Thistle is among a handful of Eastern Cape restaurants to be featured in the 2016 Diners Club Winelist Awards, with a platinum award. The Royal St Andrew&#39;s is part of the Mantis Collection.
