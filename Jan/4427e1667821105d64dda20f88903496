The Albany Bowling Club will be represented by Billy Krige and Marlene Jacobs at the Eastern Province Mixed Pairs finals in Port Elizabeth last&nbsp;weekend. The Albany pair won Section 2, thus automatically qualifying for the finals. Rob Croly and Bryony Shone of Kenton Bowling Club won Section 1 and were crowned overall Eastern Areas champions, finishing with six points. Krige and Jacobs finished as runners-up with four points. The Eastern Areas mixed pairs started on 7 and 8 January with a total of 24 teams making up Section 1 and 2.&nbsp; Section 1 was played at Grahamstown Bowling Club, while Section 2 was played just up the road at Albany Bowling Club. Teams taking part represented the Eastern Areas Bowling Clubs, Grahamstown, Albany, Port Alfred, Kowie and Kenton.&nbsp; After playing three rounds each, the winning pairs in each group moved on to the play-offs, which took place last weekend. The Section 1 winners faced the Section 2 winners to determine the overall Eastern Areas champions.&nbsp; Krige and Jacobs and Croly and Shone will now face the top two teams from the various regions in EP. This will determine the overall EP champions. &nbsp; The EP Mixed Pairs Championship takes place at the Westview Bowling Club in Port Elizabeth on 21 and 22 January.
