Accused in the Extension 6 dam murder case Thembani &#39;Zion Eyes&#39; Onceya and his four co-accused briefly appeared in the Grahamstown Magistrate&#39;s court today Monday 23 January and their case was postponed to 3 March. The other four accused are Akhona Onceya, Simamkele Onceya, Mzwanele Maki and Siviwe Qotholo.&nbsp; The five were arrested in connection with the gruesome murder of Themebelani Qwakanisa in October last year. The body of the 29-year-old man was recovered from Zion Dam in Extension 6, wrapped in a carpet. Thembani was the last to be arrested after he handed himself over to the police, saying that he knew nothing about Qwakanisa&#39;s death. The 28-year-old former third-year Anthropology student at Rhodes University applied for bail last year. The court denied bail, stating that granting him bail might lead to public disturbance and could compromise his well-being. It was stated at the time that there was evidence Onceya&#39;s safety might be compromised should the court release him and his release would also undermine public confidence in the criminal justice system. A source said Thembani had appealed his denial of bail by the magistrate&#39;s court last year. The source said documents for the bail appeal were already in the high court in Grahamstown, having been sent there in December. &quot;It&#39;s up to the high court now to decide if it is granting him the bail or not,&quot; the source said. &quot;If the high court grants Thembani bail then he will have to pay the amount that the high court will require and he will be released from prison. &quot;He is the only one of the five accused who has requested bail,&quot; the source said. &quot;If he is granted bail and pays the money, he will be free and will only appear on the dates set by the court.&quot;&nbsp;
