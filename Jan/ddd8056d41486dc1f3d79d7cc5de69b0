An act of generosity turned into a terrifying ordeal in a High Street office this morning Thursday 26 January when armed robbers took R15 000 from a grieving mother, assaulting her and leaving several people including a toddler traumatised after they were forced to lie on the floor. The incident occurred in the Democratic Alliance&#39;s High Street Grahamstown constituency offices. The DA&#39;s chief whip Mlindi Nhanha told Grocott&#39;s Mail said some of the party&#39;s members to put their hands in their pockets to help an Alicedale mother bury her son. The woman, whose identity Grocott&#39;s Mail is withholding for her protection, had written to the DA asking for assistance, since she couldn&rsquo;t afford to return home and bury her son, who had died in an accident in Pretoria on 11 January. &quot;Since we couldn&rsquo;t use party funds for this, we decided to collect money among ourselves,&quot; Nhanha said.&nbsp; They collected R15 000 for the funeral, which was to be tomorrow, and deposited it into the woman&#39;s account. The woman approached a Grahamstown undertaker to organise the funeral and yesterday came to town with her brother to finalise the arrangements. Starting off at the undertaker&#39;s, she told him she was going to the bank to transfer the money to his account.&nbsp; &quot;The undertaker said I should rather withdraw the money and pay it in cash,&quot; the woman told Grocott&#39;s Mail, soon after the incident. &quot;He took us to the bank and dropped us there in High Street,&quot; she said. &quot;I went in together with my brother and withdrew R5 000 which was the limit. A female employee of the bank assisted us and we went inside the bank to withdraw the remaining R10 000. &quot;We left the bank and came here to the DA offices, [to thank them for] the money we received from their members&#39; pockets.&nbsp; &quot;That is where all the drama happened,&quot; said the woman. Nhanha said a few party members and the two-year-old daughter of one of them were in the office. &quot;We were chatting and it was around 10am. It was not even two minutes after [the woman] came into the office, followed by two men. Nhanha was at the time handing over cash to one of their members for another reason. &quot;I was giving one of our members R300 for our strategic planning meeting. I noticed that she was not focusing on me, but was looking behind me,&quot; Nhanha said. &quot;As I turned to see what she was looking at, I saw a man pointing a firearm at me.&nbsp; &quot;Immediately I took the two-year-old to her mother and they went to hide under a table. &quot;They asked us to lie down on the floor and we did that.&nbsp; &quot;They went to the woman and asked for her purse. She gave it to them and they searched it but didn&#39;t find anything,&quot; said Nhanha. The woman said after finding nothing in the bag, they threw it at her and started assaulting her. &quot;They were kicking and pushing me all the time. They asked where the money was and threatened to shoot me in the head if I did&#39;t tell them. &quot;I had hidden the R10 000 and the R5 000 in separate places. I told them that the money was in the purse and they took it again. &quot;They opened the zip and emptied the purse and they found the R10 000. They asked where is the remaining money and I said its in the wallet. They opened the wallet and took the R5 000,&quot; said the woman. The DA&#39;s Darryn Holm said there were cellphones and a laptop on the table, but the robbers had ignored those.&nbsp; The family is now in desperate straits, because the funeral is tomorrow, but now they don&#39;t have money to pay for it. They opened a case with the police, whom Nhana complimented for their swift response. The robbers also took the R300 Nhanha was handing to a party member. Nhanha said no one was hurt during the robbery; however, the two-year-old was traumatised. Grahamstown police spokesperson Captain Mali Govender confirmed the incident and said a case of robbery with a firearm is under investigation.
