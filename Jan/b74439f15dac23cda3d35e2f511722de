A spaza shop owner who was robbed in broad daylight yesterday Monday 23 January says he&#39;s convinced no one from that area was involved. The victim, who for his safety cannot be named, said cash was taken from his shop and a stock delivery vehicle.&nbsp; The shop owner was alone when the robbery happened around 12.30pm, as the delivery vehicle parked outside to drop off stock. &quot;It happened so fast,&quot; the man said. &quot;As I opened the door so the stock could be put inside my shop, four men quickly came inside and two of them pointed firearms at me. &quot;They searched me and forced me into the toilet here inside my house. They left me there and went on to take my money and locked me inside the shop.&quot; He had been counting out cash to pay for new stock. &quot;Apparently they proceeded to the driver of the delivery vehicle. They demanded keys and took [a sum of money] that was in the vehicle. They locked it and fled with the vehicle keys,&quot; said the shop owner. He said it was the first time he&#39;d experienced a robbery at his shop and he didn&#39;t suspect anyone from that area.&nbsp; &quot;All the people in this area are very nice and can&#39;t do something like that,&quot; the man, an immigrant originally from Pakistan, said. He suspected the robbers had been following the delivery vehicle because of the way things happened. Grahamstown police spokesperson Captain Mali Govender confirmed the incident and said the police were looking for the four men, who had fled the scene. A case of &nbsp;business robbery is under investigation at Joza police station. On Thursday 12 January, three men used a toy firearm to rob a spaza shop in Extension 10, also in daylight. Cash and a cellphone were stolen. One of the suspects was arrested. Police have urged any person with information on the incidents to call their nearest police station or the crime stop number on 0860 010 111.&nbsp; Govender said all information is strictly confidential and the caller has a choice to remain anonymous.
